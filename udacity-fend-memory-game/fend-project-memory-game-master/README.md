## Description: 
The Memory Game is a card game in which we have a 4x4 grid of 16 cards facing down. The deck contains 8 different pairs of cards, in which each pair contains a unique symbol. In each turn, the player flips two cards up and tries to match each card with its corresponding pair. If the 2 cards have been successfully matched, the cards will be facing up, otherwise both will remain facing down. The aim is to match all the pairs with the smallest number of moves and within the fastest time possible as displayed on the timer. The higher the number of moves, the lower the number of stars. The game finishes when every pair of cards have been found.
